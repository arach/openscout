# macOS App Agent Notes

Verified: 2026-06-10

Source: `apps/macos/**`, `packages/scout-native-core/**`.

Status: native macOS shells after the target restructure (40b5f862..568b6898). Complements `broker.agent.md` (records) and `runtime-sessions.agent.md` (lifecycle).

## Role

One SwiftPM package, two executables. **Scout** is the product: main window (comms/agents/tail/repos) plus the HUD overlay panel it hosts. **OpenScoutMenu** (bundle `ScoutMenu.app`, id `com.openscout.menu`) is a thin supervision helper: menu-bar service lights, broker/pairing/web restart, Tailscale, signed `scout://services` links, and wake/forward into Scout. All product data flows through one shared layer, `ScoutAppCore`.

## Targets

| Target | Kind | Depends on | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ScoutAppCore` | lib | ScoutNativeCore | endpoints (`ScoutWeb`/`ScoutBroker`), comms/tail/activity models + clients, `ScoutTailStore`, `ScoutAgentsStore`, `ScoutActivityStore`, `ScoutComposeService`, `ScoutRunnerService`, `ScoutHTTP`, `ScoutServiceURLRelay` |
| `ScoutSharedUI` | lib | HudsonVoice, ScoutNativeCore | markup parser, message/code-block atoms, suggestions, `ScoutVoiceService` (wraps `HudDictation`) |
| `ScoutHUD` | lib | ScoutAppCore, ScoutSharedUI | `HUDController`, `OverlayPanelShell`, `HotkeyManager`, `ScoutHUDRouter`, `HUDStateFile`, HUD tab views + dock |
| `Scout` | exe (`com.openscout.scout`) | all above + HudsonShell, HudsonUI | main window (`ScoutRootView`), `ScoutCommsStore`, `ScoutRepoStore`, HUD hosting, scout:// handler |
| `OpenScoutMenu` | exe (`com.openscout.menu`) | ScoutAppCore, ScoutHUD, ScoutSharedUI (declared; HUD used only for `HotkeyManager`/`ScoutHUDRouter`) | `BrokerService`, `PairingService`, `TailscaleService`, `CommandRunner`, `OpenScoutToolchain`, `HUDURLRouter`, `ScoutAppBridge` |

External: `packages/scout-native-core` (`ScoutNativeCore` + `ScoutCapabilities`); Hudson resolved via `OPENSCOUT_HUDSON_SOURCE` = `path` (default, `../../../hudson`) or `git`.

## Endpoints (one resolver)

`ScoutAppCore/ScoutEndpoints.swift` is the only reader of `~/.openscout/config.json`.

| Endpoint | Resolution order | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| `ScoutWeb.baseURL()` | `OPENSCOUT_WEB_URL` / `_WEB_BUN_URL` / `_WEB_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` / `_WEB_PORT` env → config `ports.web` | `http://127.0.0.1:3200` |
| `ScoutBroker.baseURL()` | `OPENSCOUT_BROKER_URL` / `_BROKER_PORT` env → config `ports.broker` | `http://127.0.0.1:65535` |

Hosts `0.0.0.0`/`::` normalize to `127.0.0.1` client-side. `65535` is the real default broker port, not a sentinel. scoutd never reads the config file — the helper forwards `OPENSCOUT_BROKER_*` env (from `ScoutBroker.configuredEndpoint()`) when invoking it, unless the environment already pins a target.

Clients: comms/agents/activity/compose/runner hit web `api/*`; tail hits broker `v1/tail/*`.

## Relations

```text
ScoutNativeCore ← ScoutAppCore ← ScoutHUD ← Scout (+ ScoutSharedUI, HudsonShell/UI)
                  ScoutAppCore ←──────────── OpenScoutMenu (+ ScoutHUD for hotkey/router)
HudsonVoice ← ScoutSharedUI ← {ScoutHUD, Scout}
Scout.app  — embeds + autolaunches → Contents/Library/LoginItems/ScoutMenu.app
helper     — wakes/launches Scout via ScoutAppBridge (NSWorkspace + launch args)
```

## IPC / scout:// scheme

Both bundles register `scout` (Info.plist + ScoutInfo.plist); routing is bidirectional:

| Channel | Direction | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `scout://hud/{show,hide,toggle,tab/<name>,size/<name>}` | OS → either bundle | Scout handles directly (`ScoutHUDRouter`); helper forwards via notification |
| `scout://services/restart/{broker,relay,web,all}` | OS → either bundle | helper executes after HMAC verify; Scout forwards via `com.openscout.services.url` notification |
| `com.openscout.hud.command` (distributed notif) | helper → Scout | `command` + `value`; Scout also accepts `channel`/`open-channel` |
| launch args `--hud --hud-command <c> --hud-value <v>` / `--channel <cId>` | helper → cold Scout | `ScoutAppBridge` uses these when Scout isn't running |
| `/tmp/openscout-hud-state.json` | Scout → external | `HUDStateFile` mirror: visible/tab/size/windowId/ts (the query side of the HUD API) |
| `/tmp/openscout-hud-window.txt` | Scout → external | window id for `screencapture -l` |

Services-link HMAC: query `expires`+`nonce`+`sig`; SHA256 HMAC over `v1\nservices\n<action>\n<target>\n<expires>\n<nonce>`, key = base64url file `~/Library/Application Support/OpenScout/service-link-signing.key` (`OPENSCOUT_SUPPORT_DIRECTORY` override); expiry must be within +120s; timing-safe compare.

## Lifecycle & keyboard

| Behavior | Detail |
|---|---|
| Activation policy | Scout starts `.regular`; `--hud` launch starts `.accessory` and hides non-panel windows; last window close → `.accessory`, never terminates; reopen → `.regular` |
| Hotkeys (Carbon, sig `OSCT`) | Scout id 1: Hyper+H → HUD toggle. Helper id 2: Hyper+C → `openComms` (ensures web server via `scout server start`, then launches/activates Scout) |
| HUD panel | `HUDController` singleton; non-activating `OverlayPanel`, mouse-screen centered, fade in/out, outside-click dismiss (220ms), Esc cascade (cheatsheet → dock text → chip → blur → unengage → dismiss) |
| HUD keys | one shared `handleKeyDown` for panel `onKeyDown` + global monitor; global path gated by `shouldHandleGlobalKey` (Esc always; else panel key / app active). Tabs 1-5 = agents/activity/tail/sessions/assistant; sizes compact/medium/large via `[`/`]`/⌘-arrows |
| Main-window keys | `ScoutKeyboardEventMonitor` (local NSEvent monitor) offers Esc + bare keys to `HUDController.handleHostKeyDown` first while HUD visible; only unclaimed events drive window navigation |

## Data flow

| Store | Target | Cadence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ScoutTailStore` | ScoutAppCore | 1.4s poll; discovery sub-fetch ≤ 1/30s | merge-by-id, 700-event cap; feeds Tail surface + HUD tail |
| `ScoutAgentsStore` | ScoutAppCore | 2.0s | HUD agents |
| `ScoutActivityStore` | ScoutAppCore | 2.0s | HUD activity |
| `ScoutComposeService` | ScoutAppCore | SSE reply stream | shared compose/route/assistant thread |
| `ScoutCommsStore` | Scout | adaptive: 2.5s working / 10s idle / 30s error backoff | main-window channels/messages/agents |
| `ScoutRepoStore` | Scout | 30 min (manual refresh primary) | shells out to git per worktree |

Discipline: every store publishes through `setIfChanged`/`scoutSetIfChanged` (no-op writes don't fire `objectWillChange`); pollers run only between `start()`/`stop()`, gated by visibility (`syncScopedStoreLifecycles`: tail only on Tail section sans modal, repos only on Repos; HUD stores start/stop with panel appear/disappear). High-churn tail is held in `ScoutFeeds`, a non-publishing box in `ScoutRootView`, so only leaf observers re-render.

## Build & tooling

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| dev build | `cd apps/macos && bun bin/scout-app.ts dev-build` (path Hudson, debug; `dev` also relaunches) |
| release-ish build | `bun apps/macos/bin/scout-app.ts build` (git Hudson, release) |
| raw swift | `HUDSONKIT_WITH_VOICE=1 swift build` — voice flag is mandatory |
| helper bundle | `bun apps/macos/bin/openscout-menu.ts build|launch|restart|status` |
| HUD CLI | `bun apps/macos/bin/openscout-menu.ts hud state|show|hide|toggle|tab <t>|size <s>|capture|matrix` (actions via `open -g scout://hud/*`, queries via state file) |
| installer | `apps/macos/scripts/build-dmg.sh` → Hudson `hkit` (`HUDSON_DIR`/`HKIT_BIN`), contract `hudson-package.json`, embeds ScoutMenu.app under LoginItems; `SKIP_NOTARIZE=1` for local |

## Invariants

1. One endpoint resolver: all web/broker URLs go through `ScoutWeb`/`ScoutBroker`; nothing else reads `~/.openscout/config.json` or hardcodes ports.
2. `0.0.0.0`/`::` config hosts always normalize to `127.0.0.1` before use as a client target.
3. One data layer: any store/client/model used by more than one target lives in `ScoutAppCore`. The HUD is a presentation of those stores, never a parallel implementation.
4. Stores publish via `setIfChanged` and are visibility-gated — every `start()` has a `stop()` tied to a surface being on screen.
5. Scout hosts the HUD panel and owns Hyper+H; the helper only forwards HUD commands (notification when Scout runs, launch args when cold).
6. Main-window keyboard yields to a visible HUD before handling bare-key navigation.
7. `scout://services/*` executes only in the helper and only with a valid, unexpired HMAC signature; Scout forwards, never executes.
8. Scout never terminates on last-window close — it flips `.regular` ↔ `.accessory`.
9. The helper stays supervision-only: service lights, restarts, pairing, Tailscale, wake-Scout.

## Forbidden

- Read `~/.openscout/config.json` (or invent a default port) anywhere outside `ScoutEndpoints.swift`.
- Add product surfaces (comms/chat/tail UI) to `OpenScoutMenu` — it was just stripped of them (924a88d4).
- Duplicate a ScoutAppCore store per target, or give the HUD its own fetch path when a shared store exists.
- Assign `@Published` values directly in poll loops, bypassing `setIfChanged`.
- Window-lifetime pollers: `start()` without a visibility-gated `stop()`.
- Handle `scout://services` terminally in Scout, or `scout://hud` terminally in the helper.
- Grow helper dependencies toward HudsonShell/HudsonUI or anything heavier than the hotkey/router slice of ScoutHUD it actually uses.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/macos && bun bin/scout-app.ts dev-build      # debug build (path Hudson, voice on)
bun apps/macos/bin/openscout-menu.ts hud state        # reads /tmp/openscout-hud-state.json
bun apps/macos/bin/openscout-menu.ts hud show
bun apps/macos/bin/openscout-menu.ts hud tab tail
bun apps/macos/bin/openscout-menu.ts hud capture /tmp/hud.png
open -g 'scout://hud/toggle'                          # scheme ingress, either bundle
```

Expect: build succeeds without plain `swift build` voice failures; `hud state` reflects each action within ~1s.
